Hypotheses for deployment failure:

Misconfigured Kubernetes resources
Issues with AWS services or permissions
Application compatibility problems with the new environment
Network or security group misconfiguration
Resource constraints (CPU, memory, storage)
Steps to resolve:

Check Kubernetes logs:
Use kubectl get pods to list all pods
Use kubectl logs <pod-name> to check application logs
Look for error messages or unexpected behavior
Verify AWS service status:
Check the AWS Status page for any ongoing issues
Ensure all required AWS services (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, etc.) are running correctly
Review IAM permissions:
Confirm that the IAM roles and policies are correctly set up
Verify that the EKS cluster has the necessary permissions to access other AWS resources
Validate Kubernetes configurations:
Review and validate all Kubernetes YAML files (deployment, service, ingress, etc.)
Ensure all environment variables and secrets are correctly defined
Check resource allocation:
Review the resource requests and limits in the Kubernetes deployment
Ensure the EKS cluster has sufficient capacity to run all pods
Verify network settings:
Check VPC, subnet, and security group configurations
Ensure that all necessary ports are open and routing is correct
Test the application locally:
Run the application in a local Kubernetes environment (e.g., minikube)
Verify that all components work correctly before deploying to AWS
Prompts for more information:

Can you provide the specific error messages or logs from the failed deployment?
Which step of the deployment process is failing (e.g., building container image, pushing to registry, creating Kubernetes resources)?
Are there any specific AWS services that are not responding or showing errors?
Have there been any recent changes to the application code or infrastructure configuration?
Are all the required environment variables and secrets correctly set in the Kubernetes configuration?
Please provide any relevant information about the deployment failure, and we can help you troubleshoot the specific issue.
