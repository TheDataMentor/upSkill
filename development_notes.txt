    - Implement custom performance metrics for critical operations
    - Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the code
    - Set up alerts for performance degradation and error rates
    - Implement Flask-MonitoringDashboard for detailed Flask application monitoring
    - Monitor Celery task queue performance and adjust worker count as needed

15. Scalability Considerations:
    - Evaluate the use of serverless computing for certain functions
    - Consider implementing a service mesh for better service-to-service communication
    - Explore the use of GraphQL for more efficient API queries
    - Implement database sharding strategies for horizontal scaling of data

16. Frontend Optimizations:
    - Implement lazy loading for components and images in the React frontend
