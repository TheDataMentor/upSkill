   - Verify that rate limit headers are present in responses
   - Test fallback to in-memory rate limiting when Redis is unavailable

3. Verify rate-limiting functionality
   - Test rate limits on all API endpoints
   - Check for correct rate limit headers in responses
   - Ensure proper fallback to in-memory rate limiting when Redis is unavailable

4. Test and verify rate-limiting system
   - Confirm rate limits are applied correctly for all API endpoints
   - Verify rate limit headers are present and accurate in responses
   - Test fallback mechanism to in-memory rate limiting when Redis is unavailable
   - Ensure global rate limiting and burst limits are functioning as expected

5. Verify and test the sophisticated rate-limiting system
   - Ensure rate limits are applied correctly for all API endpoints
